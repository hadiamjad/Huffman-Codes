# Huffman-Codes
In this I have build a file compression algorithm that uses binary trees and min binary heaps (priority queues). Your program will allow the user to compress and decompress files using the standard Huffman algorithm for encoding and decoding. I have also implemented my own hash table, which youâ€™ll then use in implementing the Huffman encoding.
